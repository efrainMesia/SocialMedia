# SocialMedia
C++ project in OpenUniversity.
The assigment was to simulate a Social Media in C++, as a start for the course.
During this project I understood how manage memory and think more how to develop more efficient.
I also learnt about Friends Class and how to work with Headers in C++ (it was a nightmare for me in C ðŸ˜‚)
