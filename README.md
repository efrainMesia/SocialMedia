# SocialMedia
C++ project for the OpenUniversity.
The assignment was to simulate a Social Media in C++, as a first project for the course. 
During this project I learned how to manage memory allocation? and how to develop more efficiently. 
I also learnt about Friends Class, and how to work with Headers in C++ (it was a nightmare for me in C ðŸ˜‚)
